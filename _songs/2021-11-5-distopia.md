<p><span class="teaser">“After the frozen head of Walt Disney returns to complete his final project, Vera Nelson, a proud Disney Adult, thinks she's in for the life of her dreams after moving to his new Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. However, not everything is right in EPCOT, and when she gets entangled with The Lost Boys, a cynical group of revolutionaries, she must attempt to maintain her innocence while facing the person her childhood hero has become... and may always have been.”</span></p>
<p><i>A studio album and original cast album of the soundtrack is currently in progress!</i></p>
